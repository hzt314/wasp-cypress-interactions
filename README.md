# wasp-cypress-interactions
This repository includes ALL scripts used in the study of wasp-cypress project, 2021-2025

This R code is associated with the paper: Jingge Kuang et al. (2025) "Rising temperature amplifies specialized insect-plant interactions" 

The scripts were written by Jingge and Zhitong. Please do not hesitate to direct any queries to zhitonghan7@gmail.com. The data used in the scripts is available via Zenodo: 

cPSMC_plot.R - This script prepares and plots the c-PSMC reults.

intesect_bio1_cogwas.R / snp_selection.R / preparing.R - These 3 scripts prepare the input files of co-GWAS, take intersection of the co-GWAS identified SNPs with temperature-associated SNPs and plot the results.

stats.R / stats_2.R / stats_3.R - These scripts run statistics.

morph.R - This script conducts all morphlogical analysis in this study.

rna_conlinear.R / rna_diff.R / extraction.R - These 2 scripts conduct all transcriptome analysis.
